# user_context_based_search_enhancer

A context-aware news search engine that gives the most customized news search results possible.

We wish to use NewsCathcer API (https://newscatcherapi.com/) as the source of all searched news.

Even though we all use Google/Twitter/Bing all the time, we know things could be better. Sometimes we are not looking for content with the most clicks, but more about the the things that are more relevant to us.

If the system knows the user is a Tesla owner and just searched some roadtrip destinations, the system would probably know “Tesla break down” is more likely about immediate road side help. Similarly, if you are a huge NBA guy, when you search “warriors” the system could only recommend things about Golden State Warriors. If you are big on Twitter, the system can rank Twitter content much higher near the top whenever you are searching some Trending terms.

The goal is to build a customized search engine that will recommend most customized, relevant, and interesting content to user. It will focus on processing the search based on user’s context (precision), instead of going across all the sources (recall), and try to get the most popular content.
